# TicTacToe

This is a fun game to play

Start by cloning the repo.

Then, to run the game, cd into the root directory and type:

`ruby lib/run.rb`


**Playing the game.**

Upon executing the above command, you will be prompted to enter in your game play preferences.
Simply enter in the requested information at each prompt and press [Enter].


**Special note for Single Player games**

Occasionally, the computer will take several seconds to make a move.  When you see the following:

`I'm thinking of a move. One moment please...`

simply wait unti the board appears again with the computer player's choice and you are prompted
to make your move.

Thanks for playing!  Enjoy!
